# Homework
As part of the project we are working on existing code and improving it without changing what it does.
Considering the web accessibility of the page, I have added alt attribute in the image which helps the 
people with disabilities to access the website using assistive technologies like video captions, screen readers,
This helps the site to rank higher in search engines like Google
and braille keyboards.
Improvig the code by using semantic elements such as <header>, <nav>, <aside> and <footer>.
I managed to consolidate the selectors and properties, organizing them 
to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.
